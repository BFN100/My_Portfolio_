# My_Portfolio_
This is my portfolio, my work

I created this portfolio to start showing the small and large programs that I have created or am currently working on.

##

Detail: I haven't finished my portfolio yet, I'll add more projects and make it responsive, as soon as I finish I'll publish the new version here and remove this comment.

Here are pictures showing more or less how it turned out:
